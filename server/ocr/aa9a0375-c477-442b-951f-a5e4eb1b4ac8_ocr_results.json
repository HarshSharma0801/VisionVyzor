Do not place the pressure cooker in a\nheated oven.\n\n5. Do not wash in a dishwasher.\n\n6. Extreme caution must be used when\nmoving a pressure cooker containing hot\nliquids.\n\n7. Do not use pressure cooker for other\nthan intended use.\n\n8. This appliance cooks under pressure of\n103 kPa (15 Ibs/in\u2019). Improper use may result\nin scalding injury. Do not use the unit unless\nit is properly closed. See \"How to Close the\nHawkins Ventura\" on the inside front cover.\n\n9. Always check that the steam vent is clear\nimmediately before closing the lid for pressure\ncooking.\n\n10. The pressure regulator is an accurately\nweighted device to regulate operating\npressure. Never place anything over the\npressure regulator while cooking.\n\n11. Always place water as indicated in each\nrecipe (or one cup for every 10 minutes of\npressure cooking time) in the pressure cooker\nbody before pressure cooking.\n\n12. Do not fill the unit over % full. When\ncooking foods that expand during cooking\nsuch as rice or dried vegetables, do not fill the\nunit over \u00a5% full. When cooking dal/pulses\nwhich sprout, never fill the cooker more than\nYs full. Over filling may cause a risk of\nclogging the steam vent and developing\nexcess pressure. See Food Preparation\nInstructions i.e. \"Easy Tips for Better Cooking\"\non page 11\n\n13. Be aware that certain foods, such as\napplesauce, cranberries, pearl _ barley,\noatmeal or other cereals, split peas, noodles,\nmacaroni, rhubarb, or spaghetti can foam,\nfroth and sputter, and clog the pressure\nrelease device (steam vent). These foods\nshould not be cooked in a pressure cooker.\n\n14. When the normal operating pressure is\nreached, turn the heat down so all the liquid,\nwhich creates the steam, does not\nevaporate.\n\n15. Never attempt to force open the\npressure cooker. Do not open the pressure\ncooker until the unit has cooled and internal\npressure has been released. If the handles\nare difficult to push apart, this indicates that\nthe cooker is still pressurized \u2014 do not force\nit open. Any pressure in the cooker can be\nhazardous. See \"Operating Instructions\" on\npages 15 and 16.\n\n16. Never lift pressure regulator for reducing\npressure in the case of liquid or frothing\nfoods.\n\n17. Do not use this pressure cooker for\npressure frying with oil.\n\n18. Never use the cooker body for deep\nfrying or light frying for more than\n20 minutes at a time or as an oven for dry\nheating or baking, since the strength of the\nmetal may decrease to a dangerous level.\n\n19. The safety valve is fusible type and\noperates automatically in the event of excess\npressure.

Pressure cooking\nworks by sealing the steam in a pot so that there is a rise in pressure\nto a safe, controlled extent which raises the boiling point of water and\ntherefore the cooking temperature. The steam permeates through the\nfood, tenderizing it, infusing it with flavour, preserving nutrients,\ncolour, texture and juices and cooking much faster. The Hawkins\nVentura Pressure Cooker cooks food at 121\u00b0C (250\u00b0F) at a pressure of\n15 Ib per square inch (1 kg per square cm).\n\nBenefits of Hawkins Ventura Pressure Cooking\n\nThis Manual, your Hawkins Ventura Pressure Cooker and your own\nskill will enable you to produce delicious and nutritious food quickly,\neasily and economically.\n\nFaster Cooking. Hawkins Ventura cooking can reduce normal\ncooking times by as much as half. Economical foods such as legumes\n(lentils, dried peas and beans) and tougher cuts of meat can be\ncooked to perfection in a fraction of the normal time.\n\nFuel Saving. Because food cooks faster in a pressure cooker, you\nsave fuel, and therefore money.\n\nMore Healthful. Scientific literature indicates that certain nutritive\nelements such as proteins and vitamins are better retained by pressure\ncooking. Steaming is ideal for low-calorie, low-fat cooking.\n\nMore Hygienic. The higher temperature in Ventura cooking (121\u00b0C\n\n4\n\nor 250\u00b0F) ensures completely hygienic food. The Ventura can even be\nused for sterilizing.\n\nImproves Taste. Closed cooking in super-heated steam better\nevokes the natural flavours of the food \u2014 producing delicious results.\n\nVersatile. Your Hawkins Ventura cooks a wide range of foods\nWhether parts of recipes or entire meals, the Ventura can be a\ntrusted, indispensable help in the kitchen.\n\nAdvantages of Hawkins Ventura\n\nSafe\n\ne@  Pressure-locked Safety Lid. When there is pressure inside the\ncooker, the lid is pressure-locked like a modern jetliner door. It\ncannot be opened until the pressure has fallen to a safe level.\n\ne Automatic Safety Valve is positioned such that, if it operates,\nthe steam and food are deflected safely downwards.\n\ne Automatic Air Ventile expels air automatically before cooking \u2014\nyour food is cooked in pure steam. Cooking in pure steam is\nfaster and also safer because the safety valve works at the right\ntime when required. The air ventile is a handy visual indicator of\npressure inside the cooker.\n\nFast\n\ne Black Hard Anodised Base absorbs heat quickly and evenly,\nresulting in faster cooking and more fuel saving; will not tarnish,\npit or corrode.\n", "7": "Better Pressure Regulation\n\nNew Improved Black Pressure Regulator regulates pressure\nbetter, cooks faster, saves more fuel, is easier to insert and\nremove and reduces dal sprouting.\n\nTrouble-Free\n\nLonger Lasting Gasket. As the lid fits from inside, the gasket\ndoes not get rubbed sideways every time the pressure cooker\nis opened or closed. Also, the gasket is not exposed to food\nacids in the pressure cooker due to its sealing position and\nthe protection given to it by the shape of the lid.\n\nRust Proof Components. The Hawkins Ventura Pressure\n\nCooker has special metal alloy handle bar and handle brackets\nto withstand rust.\n\nUsing Your Own Recipes\n\nWe recommend the recipes we have actually tested and\nincluded in this Manual.

In the 5 litre (5% quarts)\nHawkins Ventura the two-thirds capacity is about 13\u2019 cups/3.2\nlitres and half capacity is about 10 cups/2.4 litres.\n\nMAXIMUM FOOD LEVELS\n\nThe cooker body comes fitted with a body handle screwed\non to a body handle bracket attached to the cooker body.\nThere is a subsidiary handle attached to the cooker body,\nwhich helps carry the cooker when it is loaded. The hard anodised\nbase is black for faster cooking.\n\nThe pressure regulator/vent weight automatically maintains\nthe cooking pressure of about 15 pounds per square inch (1 kg per\nsquare cm). The pressure regulator has to be placed on the steam\nvent/vent tube and pressed into position. When the pressure\nregulator is pressed down on the steam vent, there is a slight click\nwhich indicates the pressure regulator is in the correct position.\n\nThe pressure regulator has a spring mechanism which holds\nthe pressure regulator on to the steam vent and is strong enough\nto prevent it from falling off should the lid be inverted.\n\n", "9": "On the underside of the lid, the steam vent nut secures\nthe steam vent. The steam vent nut has seven holes so that even if a\nfew holes are clogged, the other holes will allow the escape of steam.\nAlways keep the steam vent clean and check before every use by\nlooking through it.

While closing and opening, do not tilt the lid deeply into the\ncooker body. The minimum tilt that will get the lid into and out of\nthe cooker body should be used so that the lid does not touch\nthe food inside the cooker.\n\n2. Before latching the handles together, centralize the lid so that\nthe gasket is in even contact with the rim of the cooker body.\n\n3. When opening after releasing latch, do not let go of the lid handle\nor the lid will fall into the cooker.\n\n4. Squeeze the lid and body handles together at the end. This\nrequires the least force.\n\n", "11": "Trial Run\n\nEven if you have used a pressure cooker previously, take a trial\nrun before cooking in your Hawkins Ventura. This section will take\nyou step-by-step through your trial run in about 30 minutes.\n\n1. Preliminary Steps\n\nRemove label and wash cooker, removing any adhesive with\nbaby or vegetable oil. Read pages 2 to 8. Identify parts. Remove\nand place the pressure regulator on the steam vent, the gasket on the\nlid curl. Close and open the\n= pressure cooker a few times.\n\ne 2. Placing Cooker on Stove\n\nPour 2 cups water in cooker\nbody. Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml)\nlemon juice or vinegar to\nprevent discolouring the cooker.\nRemove pressure regulator from\nsteam vent.

A click indicates that the pressure regulator is in position.\nClose cooker. Place cooker on high heat.\n\n3. Ensuring a Steam-tight Seal\n\nWhen water boils, hot air and/or steam should issue only from\nthe air ventile. If steam comes out around the edge of the lid, check\nthe centralization of the lid thus: unlatch and reposition the lid by\nmoving the lid slightly towards the spot where steam is escaping\nand relatch. DO NOT TOUCH LID with bare hands since it will be hot.\n\nWRONG: STEAM COMING\nQUT FROM EDGE OF LID\n\nRIGHT: NO STEAM\nLEAKAGE\n\n4. Building Up to Full Operating Pressure\n\nAIR VENTILE \u2018DOWN\u2019 WHEN\nNO PRESSURE INSIDE\n\n.AND \u2018UP\u2019 WHEN PRESSURE INSIDE\n\nWhile hot air is expelled the air ventile taps as it moves up\nand down until it lifts automatically and seals the cooker. In about\n2 minutes, the cooker should come to full operating pressure.\n\n9\n", "12": "5. How to Recognize Full Operating Pressure\n\nAfter air ventile lifts, there is first a very low hissing sound of\nsteam from the pressure regulator. Then steam emission increases\nto full force and the pressure regulator lifts with a whistling sound.\n\nCOOKER WHISTLES AT FULL OPERATING PRESSURE\n\nThe cooker is now at full operating pressure. This is the point at\nwhich to reduce heat and start timing the recipe.\n\n6. Maintaining Pressure on Reduced Heat\n\nOnce full pressure is reached, reduce heat from HIGH to MEDIUM\nThe pressure inside the cooker will be maintained at about 15 pounds\nper square inch (1 kg per square cm). If the cooker whistles too\nfrequently, reduce the heat.\n\nIf there is no steam coming out of the pressure regulator for\na few minutes, increase the heat gradually until the steam\ncomes out.\n\nPlease remember that, particularly on electric heat, it may take\nsome time for heat level adjustments to have an effect on the\nfrequency of whistles. A little practice will make clear the correct\nheat setting and adjustments, if any, that may be required\n\n7. Releasing Pressure\n\nTurn off heat. Remove pressure cooker from heat. With a fork,\nslightly lift pressure regulator to release steam. Do not remove\npressure regulator. When cooking, release pressure as indicated in\nthe recipe or on pages 14 and 15. When the pressure has fallen,\nthe air ventile should drop automatically. If the air ventile does not\ndrop, tap it gently with a spoon. If it still does not drop, slightly lift\npressure regulator with a fork to release pressure.\n\nRELEASE PRESSURE WITH SLIGHT LIFTING OF PRESSURE REGULATOR\n\n8. Final Steps\n\nOpen cooker. Empty out water. Wash and wipe dry body, lid\nand pressure regulator. Store without closing the pressure cooker.\nBefore cooking in your Hawkins Ventura, READ THE REMAINING\nINSTRUCTIONS.\n", "13": "Easy Tips for Better Cooking\n\nRead this section after you have finished the Trial Run and Ingredients\n\nbefore cooking in your Ventura.\n\n@ See Measurements page 17 for information on weights\nBasic Pressure Cooking Steps and measures.\n1.

It is designed\nto be operated only with liquid which produces steam.\n\nWater\n\nThere must be enough\nwater (or stock, juice,\nvinegar, beer or wine) in\nthe pressure cooker to\nmake steam throughout\nthe entire pressure cooking\ntime and prevent burning.\nOils and fats do not\nproduce steam and should\nnot be counted as cooking\nliquid for steam. Cooking\nliquid should always be\nwater or a liquid which\nproduces steam.\n\nThe minimum quantity of cooking liquid required is 1 cup\nfor the first 10 minutes of pressure cooking time plus '/2 cup\nfor every subsequent 10 minutes or part thereof. This\nquantity will prevent boiling dry provided you reduce the\nheat when cooker has reached full operating pressure.\nThe same minimum quantity of water should be put in the\ncooker body when cooking in separators and molds.\n\nSome of the recipes have less (or more) cooking liquid than\nthe amount prescribed in the preceding paragraph. Foods\nsuch as meat, fish, poultry, tomatoes and other vegetables\ngive off juices during cooking (whereas legumes and rice\nabsorb liquid). The recipes and charts reflect this.\n\nDo not cook with less cooking liquid than stated in the\nrecipe as you run the risk of either a ruined recipe or having\nto replace a safety valve \u2014 or both.\n\nIf you open the cooker and decide to cook longer,\n\n= always check that there is\nenough cooking liquid to\nbring back to pressure\nand cook further.\n\n@ The Hawkins Ventura\nPressure Cooker should\nnever be used as an oven\nfor dry heating or baking\nas it reduces the strength\nof the metal.\n\nTiming\n@ Start timing recipes when\n\nthe pressure cooker reaches full operating pressure\n(first whistle).\n\nUse a kitchen timer or watch/clock. Exact timing is critical to\nsuccessful pressure cooking. Counting whistles may give\nyou the wrong time required for cooking any particular\nfood or recipe. Pressure cooking is much faster than\nconventional cooking so timing errors have greater\nconsequences. If in doubt, cook for less time rather than\n", "17": "more. It is possible to correct undercooking by cooking or\npressure cooking more; you cannot reverse overcooking.\n\nIf the food is only slightly undercooked, you may be able\nto complete the cooking without pressure. This method\nis especially suitable for foods which are easily\novercooked. If the food requires more pressure cooking,\ndecide how many minutes, ensure there is enough\ncooking liquid for the extra time, and bring cooker back to\nfull operating pressure and cook the additional time.\n\nCooking times given in\nthis Manual are a guide.\nMore or less time may\nbe necessary depending\non the age, tenderness\nand variety of the\ningredients and how well\ncooked you prefer the\nfood to be. Experience will\nenable you to adjust the\ntimes suitably.\n\nPressure cooking time is\ndetermined primarily by the\nsize and shape of the ingredients and not the quantity.\nIf you are cooking pieces of food smaller or larger than those\nin a recipe, adjust cooking time accordingly.\n\n\u201cPressure Cooking Time 0 minute\u201d in the charts and\nrecipes signifies that the pressure cooker is to be taken off\nthe heat as soon as the pressure cooker has reached full\nOperating pressure.\n\nReducing Heat\n\nReaching full operating pressure is also the signal to\nreduce the heat level.\n\nOnce full pressure is reached, reduce heat from HIGH\nto MEDIUM. If the cooker whistles too frequently, reduce\nthe heat. The heat setting required varies according to the\ntype and quantity of food in the cooker and the stove.\n\nIf there is no\n\nsteam coming out of the pressure\nregulator for a few minutes,\nincrease the heat gradually\n\nuntil the steam comes out.\n\ne@ Cooking on high heat\nafter full pressure is\nreached does not result\nin faster cooking.

This takes from about\n10 to 20 minutes, depending on the type and quantity of\nfood and the size of the cooker. This method is required\nfor soups, legumes, recipes containing leavening agents\nand custards.\n\n2. \u201cRelease pressure with slight lifting of pressure\nregulator\u201d means to lift the pressure regulator slightly with\na fork and allow steam to escape so the lid can be\nopened immediately. This\nmethod is required for\neasily overcooked foods\nsuch as delicate vegetables\nand fish. This method cannot\nbe used when the cooker\ncontains predominantly\nliquid foods as the food/\nliquid may come out of the\nsteam vent.\n\n3. \u201cRelease pressure by\nplacing cooker in about\n4 inches/10 cm of cold water\nin a basin or in a sink for\n2 minutes\u201d means that the cooker is set in water for a few\nminutes and opened when the pressure has fallen. Do\nnot run water over the lid. This method is required when\nthe cooker contains liquid or frothing foods and you wish\nto open immediately.\n\nEach recipe indicates the method of releasing pressure.\nSome foods, such as rice, are cooled naturally for\n5 minutes before releasing steam.\n\nBeyond the requirements discussed above, how to\nrelease pressure is one of personal preference. Some\ncooks believe that the texture, tenderness and taste of food,\nespecially meat, are improved by allowing to cool\nnaturally whenever possible.\n\nThe method of releasing pressure has a bearing on the\npressure cooking time. In cases where it is possible to change\nfrom immediate opening to cooling naturally, reduce\npressure cooking time by 2 to 3 minutes. Similarly, if it is\npossible to change from\ncooling naturally to immediate\nopening, increase pressure\ncooking time by 2 to\n3 minutes.\n\nHow to Get the Best Out\nof Recipes\n\ne@ Read the entire recipe\nbefore beginning to work.\nAssemble and prepare\ningredients as required.\n\n@ Unless otherwise noted, in\nthe recipes:\n\n1.

Close cooker. Bring to full pressure on high heat. Reduce\nheat and cook 5 minutes. Allow to cool naturally. Open cooker.\nWash and wipe dry. Do not use abrasive powders, bleach, ash,\nsoda or mud as these will damage the finish of the cooker.\nFor stubborn spots, a fine soap-impregnated steel wool pad may\nbe used sparingly as it can over time lead to pit marks.\n\nLoss of Shine\n\ne@ With use, the aluminium cooker body and lid may lose\ntheir shine. The loss of shine is the normal behavior of the metal\nover time.\n\nRemoving Stains Caused by Chemicals in the Water\n\ne@ The inside of the cooker body may become darker due to\nminerals in the water. This darkening is neither injurious to health\nnor does it affect the taste and quality of food. To remove stains\nfrom inside the cooker body: fill cooker with water to half its\ncapacity. Add 2 teaspoons tartaric acid (cream of tartar) or\nlemon juice for each quart/litre of water. Bring cooker to full\npressure on high heat and cook 15 minutes. If you wish to\nremove stains from the upper half of the cooker body, do\nnot pressure cook. Fill cooker with enough of the same\nwater-tartaric acid solution to cover the stains. Boil 30 minutes.\nWash and then dry with a soft, clean cloth. Use these\nmethods periodically to keep the inside of the cooker stain-free.\nDo not apply the lemon juice or tartaric acid solutions to\nthe black base as they may damage the finish.\n\nStoring\n\ne@ Allow the cooker and all its parts to dry completely before\nstoring\n\n@ The gasket should be stored fitted in the lid curl.\n\n@ Store the cooker open to avoid mustiness.\n\nHow to Prevent Unnecessary Fusing of the Safety Valve\n1. Check that the steam vent is clear by looking through it.\n\n2. Do not fill the cooker more than */s (for liquid foods, not more\nthat half.)\n\n3. Do put enough water for the cooking time (Check water quantities\nin this Manual).\n\n4. Do not place the pressure cooker on an industrial burner or\nstove \u2014 use only a domestic stove.\n\n5. Do reduce heat to medium when the pressure cooker reaches\n\u201cFull Operating Pressure\u201d (See Trial Run page 10).\n\n6. Do take the pressure cooker off the stove when its cooking\ntime is complete (Check cooking time in chart or recipe as\nappropriate)\n\nReplaceable Parts\n\ne@ Always use genuine Hawkins spare and replacement parts\nfor safety and the durability of the cooker.

This is simply done by changing\nit with a replacement Hawkins Ventura gasket (see page 8).\n\nReplacement of Plastic Handles\n\nThe subsidiary handle, the body handle and the lid handle\nare replaceable by unscrewing the existing handle and screwing\non the replacement handle with a screwdriver. Clean any\naccumulated dirt from the area before attaching the new handle.\n\nIf the subsidiary or the body handle is difficult to unscrew,\na second person holding the cooker body firmly while one\nperson turns the handle screws anti-clockwise will make it\neasier. If the lid handle is difficult to unscrew, the lid should be\nheld on a soft surface such as a folded cloth to avoid\ndamaging the lid and handle bar. If any of the handles is difficult\nto unscrew, immerse the handle in boiling water for about\n5 minutes. Remove. Use a cloth or oven mitts when holding the hot\nmetal and unscrew.\n\nSafety Valve Replacement\n\n1. Get a genuine Hawkins safety valve.

Immerse the lid (but not the plastic handle) in very hot water and\nsoak for 1 hour. Wipe lid dry.\n\n3. Hold and brace the lid on\na soft surface such as a folded\ncloth. Take care not to bend or\nwarp the lid curl. Do not hold\nthe lid by the handle. Place the\nround end of one spanner (or the\nratchet spanner) on the valve on\nthe underside of the lid in such a\nway that you will be able to exert\ndownward pressure while turning\nthe valve anti-clockwise.\n\n35\n", "38": "4.

To blanch almonds: Pour\nboiling water over nuts, cover and allow to cool. Slip off skins. To\nblanch and peel tomatoes: Immerse tomatoes in rapidly boiling water\nfor 1 to 2 minutes and remove. Allow to cool. Remove core and skin.\n\nBlend: To combine two or more ingredients till they mix thoroughly.\nBoiling Onions: Substitute small white onions.\n\nCelery: A green vegetable. Stalks used for flavouring. Available in\nsome markets such as Crawford Market in Mumbai.\n\nClove of garlic: One of the small curved segments which make up\none whole garlic bulb. Small cloves specified in the recipes weigh\nabout 1 g and measure about 2 cm from tip to tip and about 1 cm at\nthe widest part. If you have larger cloves, adjust the quantity\nappropriately. Large cloves can be five times larger than small cloves.\n\nCoconut milk: Select a coconut without cracks or mold on the shell.\nShake coconut; you should be able to hear liquid inside; stale\ncoconuts contain little or no liquid.\n\nTo make coconut milk: Break open coconut by holding the coconut\nin one hand against a hard surface and hitting the coconut with the\nblunt side of a heavy cleaver all around its \u2018equator\u2019. At the first sign\nof a crack, hold the coconut over a bowl to collect coconut water.\nThough not coconut milk, it makes a refreshing drink. Taste a piece of\ncoconut to check if it is rancid. Break the halves into smaller pieces.\nSlip a knife between coconut meat and the shell and pry loose the\nmeat. It is customary to remove the brown skin from the meat,\n\n54\n\nwhich is done with a potato peeler or paring knife. In the Hawkins\nTest Kitchen we have compared coconut milk made from coconut\nwith and without the brown skin and found there is no difference in\ntaste but the milk made with the brown skin is slightly less white.\nCoarsely grate the coconut or cut the coconut meat into pieces of\nabout 2 inch/1.3 cm.\n\nTo extract good coconut milk always use the precise quantity of fresh\ncoconut and water stated in the particular recipe. It is advisable to\nuse hot water. Put coconut and the required water in a blender and\nmix the mixture until finely ground (about 5 minutes). Place muslin or\na double thickness of cheesecloth over a bowl. Put mixture into cloth.\nAfter cooling, gather up the corners and squeeze through as much\nmilk as possible. Measure the required milk and keep aside. The milk\nextracted first is called thick coconut milk.\n\nTo make thin coconut milk: Put the same coconut and the specified\nquantity of water in a blender. Repeat the same process of blending\nand extracting. Extra coconut can be grated and frozen.\n\nColander: A perforated bowl-shaped utensil for draining off liquids\nand rinsing food.\n\nDried basil leaves: Aromatic herb. Imparts a distinctive flavour.\n\nAvailable in some markets such as Crawford Market in Mumbai. May\nbe omitted.\n\nDried oregano leaves: See Dried basil leaves.\nDried thyme leaves:.

Since the width and thickness of ginger pieces vary,\nthe width of a piece of ginger is taken to be 1 inch/2.5 cm for\nquantities specified in the recipes. A 1 inch/2.5 cm long and\n1 inch/2.5 cm wide piece of ginger is taken to weigh 3 02/10 g.\n\nGrate (Kasna): To reduce food to fine particles by rubbing it against\nthe surface of a grater (an abrasive implement with sharp edged slits\nand perforations).\n\nGrind: To crush into bits or fine particles by rubbing between two\nhard surfaces. The traditional way to grind fresh herbs, dry spices,\n\npulses, coconut etc. is to use grinding stones (a hollow or flat stone\nslab and a stone roller called si! batta) or mortar and pestle. The\nmodern and easier method is to use any of the various electric mixers,\nblenders or grinders.\n\nDry spices may be ground to a powder in a mortar and pestle, an\nelectric coffee grinder or other spice grinder and a mixer-grinder.\nPlace spices in grinder and operate machine until the spices are the\nrequired texture.\n\n\u201cWet\u201d ingredients such as chillies, garlic, ginger, coconut and\nonions \u2014 and whenever liquid is added \u2014 can be ground with a sil\nbatta, in small electric choppers, mixer-grinders or food processors.\nFor small quantities use the mixer's small grinding attachment. Cut\nfood into small pieces or grate for easier grinding. When using an\nelectric chopper, blend on high speed about a minute. Stop. Stir the\ningredients preferably with a rubber spatula, scraping mixture from\nthe sides of the jar. Continue electric mixing at high speed, stopping\nthe machine and stirring occasionally until the mixture is the desired\nconsistency. Adding liquid enables chopped items to become a\nsmooth paste.\n\nSome recipes require grinding both wet and dry ingredients into a\npaste. If you do not have a powerful machine for grinding, it may be\neasier to grind the dry ingredients separately (for instance, in a spice\ngrinder) and add them to the wet ingredients while they are being\nground (for instance, in a mixer-grinder). A little experimentation with\nyour equipment will show the easiest way.\n\nLong-grain white rice: Polished Basmati rice is one type.\n\nMango powder (Amchur): Unripe mango which has been dried\nand then ground. It imparts a sour, fruity flavour. May be substituted\nwith lemon juice.\n\n55\n", "58": "Mava (Khoya): Milk which has been boiled down until all moisture\nhas been removed. Available at dairy shops.\n\nMuslin: A thin, plain-weaved cotton cloth.\n\nParsley: A green herb used mainly as a garnish. Available in some\nmarkets such as Crawford Market in Mumbai. May be omitted.\n\nPur\u00e9ed: To pur\u00e9e is to rub food through a sieve or blend in an\nelectric blender until the food is pulpy. If using a blender to pur\u00e9e\ntomatoes, remove cores first. Alternatively, tomatoes can be grated to\nmake a pur\u00e9e. Discard the hard skin and core, if any.\n\nRed chilli powder: Whole dried red chillies which have been\n\nground.\n\nRoasting of spices: Before grinding, spices are sometimes roasted\nto bring out the characteristic aromas and to intensify their flavour.\nTo roast, place spices in a small, heavy skillet (pan) on medium heat.\nStir continuously until the spices darken by a few shades and give out\n\n56\n\ntheir distinct aromas. Remove from heat, spread on a plate and allow\nto cool.\n\nSage: See Dried basil leaves.\n\nScald: To heat liquid to a temperature just below the boiling point\nand stop.\n\nSieve: Utensil having a perforated or meshed bottom for separating\nsolids or coarse material from liquid or fine particles.\n\nSift: To pass dry ingredients through a sieve.\n\nSimmer: To cook gently just at or below the boiling point; adjust\nheat so that bubbles form, rise and break very slowly.\n\nTomato paste: Concentrated tomato pur\u00e9e.\nVanilla extract: Vanilla essence.\n\nZucchini: Substitute peeled bottlegourd, lauki, dudhi or ghia.\n", "59": "Almonds\n\nAniseed\n\nAsafoetida\n\nBay leaves\n\nButter\n\nCabbage\nCardamoms (brown)\nCardamoms (green)\nCarrots\n\nCashew nuts\nCauliflower\n\nCelery\n\nChana dal\nCinnamon\n\nCloves\n\nCoconut\nCoriander leaves\n\nCoriander powder\nCoriander seeds\nCumin powder\nCumin seeds\nCurd\n\nTranslations to Hindi and English\n\nBadam\nSaunt\n\nHing\n\nTej patta\nMakkhan\nBandh gobi\nMoti elaichi\nChoti elaichi\nGajar\n\nKaju\nPhulgobi\nAjwain ke patte\nBengal gram\nDalchini\nLaung\n\nNariyal\n\nHara dhania ke\npatte\n\nPissa sukha dhania\nSukha dhania\nPissa jeera\n\nJeera\n\nDahi; Yogurt\n\nCurry leaves\n\nDrumsticks\nFenugreek seeds\nFlour\n\nGarlic\n\nGinger, fresh\n\nGreen beans\n\nGreen chillies\nGreen peppers\n\nJaggery\n\nKabuli chana\nLemon\n\nMace\n\nMango Powder\nMint leaves\nMoong dal\n\nMustard oil\nMustard seeds\nNutmeg\n\nOlive oil\n\nKadi patta/Meethi\nneem ke patte\n\nSahjan ki phali\nMethi dana\nMaida\n\nLassan\n\nAdrak\n\nPharasbeen;\nFrench beans\n\nHari mirch\n\nSimla mirch,\nCapsicum\n\nGur\nChickpeas\nNimbu\nJavitri\nAmchur\n\nPudina\n\nSplit skinned green\ngram\n\nSarson ka tel\nRai\nJaiphal\n\nJaitoon ka tel\n\nParsley\n\nPeapods\n\nPeas\n\nPepper\nPeppercorns\nPomegranate seeds\nPoppy seeds\nRajma\n\nRed chilli powder\nSabat urad\nSaffron threads\nTamarind\nTurmeric\n\nTurnip\n\nTuvar dal\nWhole dry red chillies\n\nVinegar\n\nAjmooda ke patte\nMatar ke chilke\nMatar\n\nPissi kali mirch\nKali mirch\nAnardana\nKhuskhus\n\nKidney beans\n\nPissi lal mirch\nWhole black gram\nKesar\n\nImli\n\nHaldi\n\nShalgam\n\nRed gram\n\nSabat sukhi lal\nmirch\n\nSirka\n\n57\n", "60": "INDEX OF RECIPES AND CHARTS\n\nBraised Chicken\n\nChana Pindi (Chickpeas \u2014 Rawalpindi Style)\nChola Dal (Bengal Gram with Coconut)\nCreme Caramel\n\nDAL CHART\n\nGajar Halwa (Carrot Pudding)\n\nHirva Masalyachi Bhaji (Vegetables\nin Green Masala)\n\nIilish Sarse Bata (Hilsa Fish in Mustard)\n\nKhichuri (Soft Rice with Green Gram\nand Vegetables)\n\nKozhi Kuttan (Chicken Curry \u2014 Kerala Style)\nLamb Stew\n\nLEGUME CHART\n\nMa ki Dal (Whole Black Gram)\n\nMansam Chops (Mutton Chops \u2014 Andhra Style)\nMEAT AND POULTRY CHART\n\n58\n\nPAGE\n50 Minestrone Soup\n37 Mixed Vegetable Pulao\n38 Mutton Biryani (Rice Layered with\n51 Spicy Mutton \u2014 Moghul Style)\n19 Rajma (Kidney Bean Curry)\n45 RICE CHART\nIndian\n44 International\n43 Rogan Josh (Mutton in Rich Gravy)\nSambar (Red Gram and\n4 Vegetable Curry \u2014 Tamil Style)\n46 SEAFOOD CHART\n49 Spanish Rice Casserole\n24 Tomato Soup\n39 VEGETABLE CHART\n48 Vegetable Stock\n21\n\nPAGE\n52\n38\n\n42\n45\n\n18\n20\n47\n\n40\n26\n53\n50\n22\n53\n", "61": "How to Open the Hawkins Ventura\n\nLl \u00a2\n\n1.
